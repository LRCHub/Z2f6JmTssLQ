[00:16.03] Throw away your television
[00:20.08] Time to make this clean decision
[00:24.06] Master waits for its collision now
[00:41.06] 
[00:30.43] It's a repeat
[00:34.37] Of a story told
[00:38.32] It's a repeat
[00:42.36] And it's getting old
[00:52.36] 
[00:47.90] Throw away your television
[00:51.97] Make a break, big intermission
[00:56.03] Re-create your super vision now
[01:11.53] 
[01:02.36] It's a repeat
[01:06.36] Of a story told
[01:10.02] It's a repeat
[01:14.09] And it's getting old
[01:24.09] 
[01:19.63] Renegades with fancy gauges
[01:23.72] Slay the plague for it's contagious
[01:27.97] Pull the plug and take the stages
[01:31.92] Throw away your television now
[01:38.23] Oy, oy, oy
[01:43.23] 
[01:43.74] Throw away your television
[01:47.73] Take the noose off your ambition
[01:51.69] Re-invent your intuition now
[02:05.69] 
[01:57.99] It's a repeat
[02:01.89] Of a story told
[02:05.96] It's a repeat
[02:09.86] And it's getting old
[02:19.86] 
[02:15.63] Renegades with fancy gauges
[02:19.44] Slay the plague for it's contagious
[02:23.74] Pull the plug and take the stages
[02:27.52] Throw away your television now
[02:42.52] 
[03:03.07] Throw away your television
[03:07.18] Salivate to repetition
[03:11.10] Alleviate this ill condition now
[03:27.10] 
[03:17.64] It's a repeat
[03:21.40] It's a repeat
[03:25.47] It's a repeat
[03:29.46] It's a repeat
[03:33.37] It's a repeat
